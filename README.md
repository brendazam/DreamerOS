# Welcome

First and foremost, Welcome! üéâ Bienvenid@s! üéä

This repository will be used to host and colobrate on guides to help Returned DREAMers reintegrate into Mexican society.

This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. 


# Who are Returned DREAMers?

Returned DREAMers are those who lived in the United States and are now in Mexico because of deportation, the fear of deportation, the deportation of a family member, and/or other obstacles.

# What do we need?

You! In whatever way you can help. ‚ù§Ô∏è

We need expertise in fundraising, app development, user experience design, database maintenance (particularly ensuring the highest quality data protection plans are in place), software sustainability, documentation and technical writing and project management.

We'd love your feedback along the way, and of course, we'd love you to be in the database once it exists.

# Get involved

If you think you can help in any of the areas listed above (and we bet you can) or in any of the many areas that we haven't yet thought of (and here we're sure you can) then please check out our [contributors' guidelines](https://github.com/laurosilvacom/DreamerOS/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [roadmap](https://github.com/laurosilvacom/DreamerOS/issues/4).

# Thank you
