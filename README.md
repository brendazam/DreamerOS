# Welcome to the DreamerOS 

Welcome! This is the DreamerOS repository. This repository will be used to host and colobrate on guides to help Returned DREAMers reintegrate into Mexican society.

Returned DREAMers are those who lived in the United States and are now in Mexico because of deportation, the fear of deportation, the deportation of a family member, and/or other obstacles.
