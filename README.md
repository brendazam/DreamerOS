# DreamOS
**Resources and community to reintegrate into Mexican society for returned DREAMers.**

# Welcome

First and foremost, Welcome! üéâ Bienvenid@s! üéä

This repository will be used to host and colobrate on guides to help Returned DREAMers reintegrate into Mexican society.

This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. 


# Who are Returned DREAMers?

Returned DREAMers are those who lived in the United States and are now in Mexico because of deportation, the fear of deportation, the deportation of a family member, and/or other obstacles.

# What are we doing

We're building online resources so those DREAMers who return to Mexico can have access to information that can make the integration to mexican society easier.

## The problem

There is not a lot or none information about facilities for DREAMers. When a DREAMer return to Mexico it's a change of life, it's a fresh start and they need assitance, but in Mexico doesn't exist information about how the DREAMers can integrate or reintegrate to mexican society. 

## The solution

A single point of content for Dreamers that have returned. Information about legal assitance, organizations dedicated to help them in Mexico and people, may be dreamers or not, around all Mexico that can help with advices and emotional support.
